# Victor Gomes

Welcome to my page everyone!

I am an engineer who found my true passion in the world of data. I found out that the power of data can improve our decision making in the financial markets, and since then have dedicated my life to making this knowledge more accessible to everyone.

I graduated from Northeastern University from Boston (MA) with a Masterâ€™s of Science in Industrial Engineering in May 2017. During my studies, I became particularly interested in Data Science and started specializing in that field. My capstone project was an application of Data Mining in the field of aviation, where I studied the relationships between airports and the cities they were in the US. I was also a Teaching Assistant for the Intro to Data Mining and Machine Learning class, which covered subjects such as linear and logistic regression, decision trees, Naive Bayes, dimensionality reduction, text mining and others. I believe machine learning and predictive analytics help businesses gain better insights into its operations and processes, thus allowing them to make better decisions.
